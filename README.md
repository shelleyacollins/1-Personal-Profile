# Homework-2-Bootstrap-Repository

This project was fun - yet very challenging! I wrote it from the perspective of a television character.
The character, Dwight K. Shrute, is an extremely interesting subject. I feel like I know the character as much
or more than I know myself at this stage in life!

At the end of the project I ran each of the .html pages through the HTML checker. There were errors I did not understand how to fix.
I will research them and fix them accordingly, however, I won't be able to do so without missing the homework deadline.

Take Two:  Corrected as much as I can understand. This website is a work in progress! ;-)
