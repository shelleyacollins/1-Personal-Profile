I have many qualifications, most of which can hardly be attained by mere mortals. Not only am I the Assistant to the Regional Manager AND Assistant Regional Manager of a very well-known paper company, but I am also the owner of the building in which that same well-known paper company is housed. In addition to my highly-coveted office titles (none of which Jim currently holds) I am also the proud owner of Scranton's one and only BEET FARM! That's right...Beets...and we have plenty of 'em. My cousin Mose and I run the farm as well as a very nice Bed and Breakfast business, located right on our property. For recommendations feel free to contact one of our previous guests, Jim and/or Pam Halpert. I'm quite sure their phone numbers are listed.</p>
                            <p>If you happen to be in the Scranton area and are in the market for either paper or beets, contact me either by phone or by submitting a form on the "Contact" page of this website. I look forward to doing business with you! P.S. I am also a Karate instructor and am accepting new students on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at the Electric City DOJO, located next door to the Electric City Sewage Company. </p>
